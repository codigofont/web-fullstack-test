# Código Font - Web FullStack test

Test of the Código Font selection process to attract new talents, wishing to become a fullstack developer.

## Initial guidelines

The test is based on the following recommended technologies:

- ReactJS
- NodeJS/Express
- MongoDB

For this, a great reference that must be analyzed for the test to be successful is [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-react-frontend-a-node-express-backend-and-connect-them-together-c5798926047c/). Use and abuse the references found in this tutorial to complete the test.

Despite this, the chosen technology is optional, so feel free to develop it in the language that you master more.

All code must be made taking into account the standard defined in the tutorial itself (codes that do not follow the same standard will be **disqualified**).

The code that the tutorial itself makes available can be used, since it is only used as a base, it is necessary that you are able to understand what it does, because without understanding it is impossible to finish the test.

Any code made by another person, or if plagiarism is found, the candidate will be automatically **disqualified from the process**.

## The challenge

The test consists of creating a mini online store. Basically, the system user must have the following features:

1. Home page with some products highlighted
2. Register / Edit new products in the system
3. Search for a product by name
4. Sort products by lowest / highest price
5. Add / Remove products to cart
6. Checkout and generate an order summary

No example screen or layout will be provided to stimulate the candidate's creativity (use all your knowledge of CSS to make a beautiful system :) ). The use of some styling framework (Bootstrap, Semantic UI, **Material UI (recommended)**) is optional.

Products and orders **must be stored in a database. For information persistence**.

## Deadline

The deadline for this test is **15 days** after the test is available. Organize your time well!

## Thanks
